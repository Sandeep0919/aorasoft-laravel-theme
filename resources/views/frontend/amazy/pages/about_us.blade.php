                            In 2019, Natalie decided to expand operations and felt nothing would be better than to develop and supply a new sporting brand in the UK. That's when FIGHTOR was born! FIGHTOR is owned and trademarked by Natalie's UK company- Sports Science Limited. The company has a vision to reach the world wide market and has itâ€™s presence felt by first class athletes and as importantly, you the consumer.
